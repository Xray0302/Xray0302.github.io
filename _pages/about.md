<!-- # üòÅ About me -->

Hi, my name is Xu Rui. I am currently a first-year PhD student in Biomedical Engineering at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), under the supervision of [Prof. Raymond Kai-Yu TONG](https://www.bme.cuhk.edu.hk/kytong/Profile.html)(AIMBE Fellow). Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate and master's studies (supervised by [Prof. Bo Tao](http://mse.hust.edu.cn/info/1142/1328.htm), Changjiang Scholar Chair Professor) at [State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Manufacturing Equipment and Technology](https://dmet.hust.edu.cn/), [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://english.hust.edu.cn/) in China, majoring in Mechanical Engineering.

My current research focuses on intention-driven robotic perception, recognition, and manipulation, with the goal of applying this technology to upper limb rehabilitation robots to assist stroke patients in achieving more efficient training. I am also interested in robotic calibration, measurement, and control technologies, particularly in high-precision vision-guided assembly strategies for industrial robots used in large components such as aircraft and satellites. Through my research, I aim to enhance the capabilities of robots in perception, recognition, and manipulation to achieve more efficient and reliable applications and solutions.
