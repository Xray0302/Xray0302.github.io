<!-- # üòÅ About me -->

Hi, My name is Rui Xu, a last year master's student (by research) majoring in mechanical engineering at [State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Manufacturing Equipment and Technology](https://dmet.hust.edu.cn/), [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://english.hust.edu.cn/) in China.  
My research primarily focuses on robot calibration, measurement, and control techniques, particularly in high-precision vision-guided assembly strategies for industrial robots used in large components such as aircraft and satellites. I explore vision image processing algorithms, point cloud matching algorithms, and cooperative planning, control, and operation of dual-arm robots. Through my research, I aim to enhance robots' capabilities in perception, recognition, and operation for more efficient and reliable solutions in industrial applications and automation.
